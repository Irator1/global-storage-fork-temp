# Global Network

A powerful networked storage system that lets you manage items across your entire factory through a unified global inventory pool.

## Features

### Global Chests - Shared Network Storage
- Place **Global Chests** and assign them a network ID (like "iron" or "copper")
- All chests with the same network ID share the same inventory instantly
- Set **min/max requests** per network to automate item distribution
- Copy-paste from assemblers to auto-configure requests from recipes

### Global Provider Chests
- Pull specific items from the global pool into logistics networks
- Configure per-chest item requests
- Perfect for feeding assemblers or buffering items

### Smart Item Distribution
- **Surplus collection**: Items above max are sent to global pool
- **Demand fulfillment**: Items below min are pulled from global pool
- Round-robin processing optimized for thousands of chests

### Storage Limits
- Control what items enter your global storage
- Set numeric limits or unlimited storage per item
- Block unwanted items from clogging your system

### Player Logistics Integration
- Your personal logistics requests pull from global storage
- Trash items automatically go into the global pool
- Pin items to HUD for real-time monitoring

### Network Management GUI (Shift+G)
- View all networks and their status
- Browse global inventory with current quantities
- Configure storage limits from one central location

## Perfect For
- **Megabases** - Scales efficiently with network-based processing
- **Mall builds** - Easy item distribution to crafting areas
- **Organized storage** - Logical grouping by network ID

## How to Use
1. Craft and place Global Chests
2. Click a chest and set its Network ID
3. Add requests (min/max) for items you need
4. Place more chests with the same ID to expand capacity
5. Use Shift+G to manage networks and view global inventory

## Tips
- Copy-paste from an assembler to a chest to auto-fill requests with recipe ingredients
- Use meaningful network names like "science-red" or "green-circuits"
- Set storage limits to prevent overflow of unwanted items
